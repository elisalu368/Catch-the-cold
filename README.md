# bee-going-home
bee going home, animation of a bee that follows the arrows on the keyboard (W=up A=left S=down D=right but currently follows the mouse). The goal is to be able to move the bee into the hive object that will be displayed. At the end of the game when the player makes it to the opening in the hive object there is a display with a fun fact about bees and how they are great! This project is my small ode to the bee population and hive that I take care of in my free time and I like the idea of incorporating more bee culture into learning and having it be fun and cute so people dont have to be as concerned about bees with stinger being aggressive and can instead lean some small fun things about how they are very important to the eco-system. Hello p5 drawing is what the gameplay should move like and the attatched image is the main character who will follow the key directions.
